# Perturbation of Lagrange Points in Effective Potential Simulations


Lagrange points are analytically proven to exist at certain positions in a two-body gravitational system, simply as a function of the gravitational force governing the motion of the bodies and the centrifugal potential due to rotation, providing regions of varying effective potentials. In a system involving interactions between the gravitational forces of multiple bodies however, the position of the Lagrange points ought to change. The purpose of this research project is to verify that the change does indeed occur when a new body is introduced, and compute the perturbation in the position of these points given various parameters.
